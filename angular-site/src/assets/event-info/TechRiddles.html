The relic has a large bounty on it and we<br />want you to get us the Relic in a heist mission and win the prize money.<br />Are you brave enough to take on this mission?<br /><br /><strong>Description</strong><br />It is a Technical Treasure Hunt just like the event from last year but with a slight twist in it. You<br />will be required to solve many riddles and puzzles to complete your final objective, which in this<br />case is Stealing an Ancient relic. This is a team event, each team consisting of 3 or 4<br />members (we recommend 4 people in a team, it cannot be more than 4 or less than 3). There<br />are no prerequisites for the event except for that you may be required to use your Android<br />Smartphones during the event (1 per team at least).<br /><br /><strong>Event Outline</strong><br />The event will have three stages. The first stage is a quiz round where you will be provided with<br />a bunch of questions to test your capabilities. The teams who clears the quiz can progress to<br />the next round, Preparation for The Heist. After this comes the final stage, The Heist where you<br />will Steal the relic. A detailed description of each stage is given below.<br />There is only one relic, so the teams who steals it successfully first will win this game.<br />Remember, your main enemy here is not time but other teams competing with you.<br /><br /><strong>First Stage (The First Test)</strong><br />We will be testing your capabilities for the mission with a small Quiz. The quiz will be consisting<br />of various logical and aptitude problems and some technology-related questions. The questions<br />will be in objective or fill in the blanks format.

As soon as you get all the things required, you will<br />be ready for the final Stage.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Third Stage (The Heist)</strong><br />Your final objective is locked behind various traps and obstacles. You have to use the items<br />acquired in the previous stage and your genius brains to clear them out. You may need to<br />distract the guard, disable traps and sneak into the room.
